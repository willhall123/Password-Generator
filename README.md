# Password-Generator

## Overview 
### When visiting the Password Generator website, you will be able to create a unique password for any use you may need. You can use it to secure major confidential forms, log in for a computer, or even as simple as adding a song on your phone from iTunes. To get started, simply click the Gererate Password button and answer the series of questions. The questions consist of how many characters, do you need upper and lowercase letter, numbers, and special characters. We use these questions for matching the criteria you may need for the password. Once you have answered all of the prompts, a password is generated for you and you may use it any way you want to! It is that easy!
